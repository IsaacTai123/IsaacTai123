## Hi! I'm Isaac
 
- 👾 Software engineer with 4 years of experience
- 🎯 Focused on software development, system design, and cloud computing
- 🔎 Check out some of my projects:
  - [Automation testing project with Selenium](https://github.com/IsaacTai123/selenium-java-web-automation.git) - Java
  - [Web server for a badminton club](https://github.com/IsaacTai123/BadmintonClub.git) - React

- 😁 Passionate about clean architecture, backend systems, and exploring cloud solutions
- 🌱 I enjoy solving problems with technology — sometimes experimenting with advanced tools even when a simpler solution exists. For me, it’s both a way to learn and a source of accomplishment.
- 🎯 While I’m mindful not to over-engineer, I see every project as a chance to explore and grow my technical toolkit.
